## Snakes and Ladders Game Program Design

### Data Structures:

1. **`players` Array**:
   - An array to store player information, including name and position.
   - Example: `[{ name: 'Player 1', position: 1 }, { name: 'Player 2', position: 1 }]`

2. **`currentPlayerIndex` Variable**:
   - A variable to keep track of the index of the current player in the `players` array.
   - Example: `0` (for Player 1), `1` (for Player 2)

### Game Rules and Logic:

1. **Roll Dice**:
   - The `rollDice` function simulates rolling a six-sided dice and returns a random number between 1 and 6.

2. **Move Player**:
   - The `movePlayer` function calculates the new position for a player based on their current position and the dice roll. It checks for snakes, ladders, game boundaries, and winning conditions.

3. **Switch Player**:
   - The `switchPlayer` function updates `currentPlayerIndex` to switch to the next player's turn, ensuring that the players take turns in sequence.

4. **Play Game**:
   - The `playGame` function simulates the entire game. It repeatedly calls the `movePlayer` function for each player, checks for winning conditions, and switches players' turns.

5. **Consecutive Sixes**:
   - The game checks for three consecutive rolls of 6. If a player rolls three consecutive 6's, their dice roll is nullified, and they lose their turn.

### Program Flow:

1. Initialize player information and variables.
2. Start the game by calling `playGame`.
3. In each player's turn, roll the dice using `rollDice`.
4. Move the player based on the dice roll using `movePlayer`.
5. Check for winning conditions and consecutive sixes.
6. Switch to the next player's turn using `switchPlayer`.
7. Repeat steps 3-6 until a player wins the game.
8. End the game and display the winner.

## Choice of Data Structures and Reasoning

1. **Array for Players**:
   - **Data Structure Choice**: An array is chosen to represent players because it's a simple and effective way to store player information. Each player is represented by an object with attributes like their name and position.
   - **Reasoning**: Arrays are an intuitive choice for handling a list of entities, and they make it easy to access and update player information during the game.

2. **Current Player Index**:
   - **Data Structure Choice**: A variable (`currentPlayerIndex`) is used to track the current player's turn.
   - **Reasoning**: A simple numerical index is sufficient for keeping track of the current player. It's easy to increment and use the modulus operation to cycle through players in a turn-based game.

3. **Functions for Game Logic**:
   - **Data Structure Choice**: Functions are used to encapsulate specific game logic, such as rolling dice, moving players, switching players, and playing the game.
   - **Reasoning**: Functions help modularize the code and improve readability and maintainability. Each function has a specific purpose, making the code easier to understand and extend.
